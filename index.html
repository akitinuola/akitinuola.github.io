Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring stare at guinea pigs why must they do that, yet claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away, instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet. Hunt anything that moves. Somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock.</p>
